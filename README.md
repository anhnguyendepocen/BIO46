This repository primarily contains lessons, code and data used to teach R in BIO 46: Research in Ecology and Evolution, taught at Stanford University. Lessons were initially developed by Jes Coyle for a pilot class during the 2017 and 2018 Winter Quarters.

## Table of Contents

### 2018

#### Code

Contains R scripts for creating the final database tables that are available in the Data folder.

#### Data

Contains the database tables. See the [README](https://jescoyle.github.io/BIO46/2018/Data/README.md) in that folder for more detailed metadata.

+ **sites**:  Location and environmental variables for Jasper Ridge survey sites.
+ **lichens**: Info about lichens collected at Jasper Ridge, including outcomes of growth and infection experiments. 
+ **fungi**: Growth rates and identities of fungi isolated from lichens.
+ **infection_prevalence**: Abundance of *E. prunastri* and infection prevalence at survey sites. + **interaction_experiment_byplate**: Outcome of fungal isolate interaction experiment for each plate.
+ **interaction_experiment_bycompetitor**: Outcome of fungal isolate interaction experiment for each competitor on a plate.
+ **ibuttons**: iButton temperature data from survey sites.
+ **humidity**: EL-USB-2 humidity logger data from three survey sites.

#### Data analysis exercises

Exercises for teaching data analysis in R. These are mostly copy-paste exercises that focus on the data used in class projects. See the [main page](https://jescoyle.github.io/BIO46/2018/Data%20analysis%20exercises/TOC.md) for this folder for more detailed descriptions of each exercise.

### 2017

#### R-lessons

Exercises for teaching data analysis in R. These are more in-depth lessons that teach students how to code in R beyond copy-paste. See the [main page](https://jescoyle.github.io/BIO46/2017/R-lessons/TOC.md) for this folder for more detailed description of each exercise.
